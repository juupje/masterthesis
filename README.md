# Thesis
This repo serves two purposes:
1. As a backup tool in case of an (inevitable) mess-up
2. As a synchronization tool between the workstation in my office, my personal computer and the university's HPC cluster

## Important notes
This repo only contains scripts and other important files. It contains no data nor any results or trained models.
